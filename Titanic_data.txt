About the Dataset :-
The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used for binary classification tasks in machine learning, particularly for predicting whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic.

The dataset consists of the following columns (features):

    1) PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.
    2) Survived: A binary indicator of whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
    3) Pclass: The passenger's class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
    4) Name: The name of the passenger.
    5) Sex: The gender of the passenger (male or female).
    6) Age: The age of the passenger (in years). Some entries may be missing.
    7) SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
    8) Parch: The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic.
    9) Ticket: The ticket number of the passenger.
    10) Fare: The fare paid by the passenger for the ticket.
    11) Cabin: The cabin number where the passenger stayed. This feature often has many missing values.
    12) Embarked: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
