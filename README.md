This document details the internship projects undertaken, their objectives, and the analytical methods applied.

Project 01:- Sales Data Analysis

The primary goal of this project is to analyze sales data to uncover key patterns and trends that can inform business decisions. This involves exploring sales performance across different customer segments, regions, and product categories.

Key Tasks:-
    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, format dates, and correct data inconsistencies.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and summarize key metrics such as total sales, profit, and average discount across regions and product categories.
    Trend Analysis: Examine seasonal and yearly sales trends to identify high-demand periods.
    Profitability Analysis: Evaluate profit margins by category, sub-category, and customer segment.
    Shipping and Order Priority Insights: Analyze shipping costs and customer preferences for shipping modes and order priority levels.

Tools and Techniques:-
    Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Data Visualization: Used to reveal patterns and key metrics
    Statistical Analysis: Applied to understand profit margins and growth trends

Project 02:- HR Data Analysis

Objective:- The HR Data Analysis project aims to study employee demographics and work-related attributes to provide insights on employee attrition, satisfaction, and performance trends.

Key Tasks:-
    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Format categorical variables, handle missing values, and prepare data for analysis.
    Employee Attrition Analysis: Identify factors correlated with employee attrition, such as distance from home, job satisfaction, and monthly income.
    Performance and Satisfaction Analysis: Explore variables like job role, job level, and satisfaction ratings to assess their impact on employee retention.
    Demographic Insights: Analyze demographics, including age, gender, and education field, to understand trends in hiring, promotions, and attrition.

Tools and Techniques:-
    Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
    Predictive Modeling: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to predict attrition likelihood
    Data Visualization: Visualizations to highlight key trends in job satisfaction and attrition

Project 03:- Titanic Survival Prediction

Objective:- This project involves building a predictive model to analyze the Titanic dataset and forecast the survival chances of passengers based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and family connections.

Key Tasks:-
    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, especially in columns like age, cabin, and embarked.
    Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model accuracy, such as family size and fare per person.
    Modeling: Develop a machine learning model to predict survival using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
    Evaluation and Tuning: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, and optimize hyperparameters to improve results.

Tools and Techniques:-
    Python Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
    Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
    Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
